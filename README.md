# 🌞 Solar Power Output Prediction Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Title  
**Predicting Solar Power Generation Using Linear Regression**

## 📖 Problem Statement  
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating solar power output using historical weather data. Accurate forecasting of solar energy production is essential for efficient energy distribution, particularly in regions that rely heavily on solar power. By leveraging linear regression, we seek to understand how environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance influence power generation, enabling better energy planning and utilization.  

## 🌱 Sustainable Energy Impact  
This project contributes to the advancement of sustainable energy solutions by optimizing solar power forecasting. Accurate predictions help in reducing dependence on fossil fuels, ensuring efficient energy storage and distribution, and promoting the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid.

## ✅ Progress Overview  

### 📌 Week 1: Data Preprocessing  

#### 1️⃣ Importing Required Libraries  
Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` were imported to facilitate data processing, visualization, and model training.  

#### 2️⃣ Loading and Inspecting the Dataset  
The dataset, containing features like temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and solar irradiance, was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for structured analysis.  

#### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values by using imputation techniques or removing inconsistent entries.  
- Identified and removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.  
- Detected outliers using statistical methods and visualization tools.  

#### 4️⃣ Statistical Summary  
Basic statistical analysis was performed using `.describe()` and `.info()` to understand feature distributions, central tendencies, and potential correlations with the target variable (solar power output).  

#### 5️⃣ Feature Scaling  
To improve model efficiency, numerical variables were standardized and normalized, ensuring consistency in data representation before applying regression analysis.

In the second week, a detailed EDA was conducted to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.  

#### 🔹 Univariate Analysis  
- **Histograms & KDE Plots** – Showed the distribution of features like temperature (normal distribution), humidity (right-skewed), wind speed (right-skewed), and cloud cover (multimodal).  
- **Box Plots** – Identified potential outliers affecting the predictive model.  
- **Pie Charts** – Illustrated the proportional distribution of cloud cover, wind speed, and power generation.  

#### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis  
- **Scatter Plots:**  
  - Temperature vs. Power: Moderate positive correlation.  
  - Humidity vs. Power: Negative correlation, indicating cloudy conditions.  
  - Wind Speed vs. Power: Slight positive correlation.  
  - Cloud Cover vs. Power: Strong negative correlation.  
  - Solar Radiation vs. Power: Strong positive correlation.  
- **Box Plots** – Compared cloud cover and wind speed’s impact on power output.  
- **Correlation Heatmap:**  
  - **Positive Correlations:** Solar radiation (~0.9), temperature (~0.6).  
  - **Negative Correlations:** Cloud cover (~-0.7), humidity (~-0.6).  

#### 🔹 Multivariate Analysis  
- **Pair Plots** – Showed interdependencies between variables.  
- **3D Scatter Plot** – Demonstrated that solar radiation is the dominant factor in power generation, with minimal dependence on temperature.  
- **Contour Plot** – Highlighted interactions between azimuth, zenith angle, and power output.
